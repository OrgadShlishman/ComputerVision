# ComputerVision
Computer Vision course in Tel Aviv University In this code there is:
- Homography and Panorama:
1. Given 2 images, computation of the homography transformation between them
2. Dealing with outliers using RANSAC
3. Panorama creation

Running is done by executing Python files. Before running, should make sure all packages are installed.

- Stereo Matching:
1. SSD computation
2. Computing depth map using Viterbi
3. Computing depth map using SGM

Running is done by executing Python files. Before running, should make sure all packages are installed.

- Facial Manipulation Detection:
1. Build network infrastructure (Dataset & Trainer)
2. Train fake faces classifier on SimplNet
3. Train fake faces classifier on Xception net
4. Train fake faces classifier on v2_MobileNet

Running is done by executing the run.sh file on Linux environment of Unbutu 16.4
